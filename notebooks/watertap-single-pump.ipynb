    "# Acquirium - WaterTap - MQTT Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a single pump simulation using WaterTap. The pump model requires six input variables. Two of these variables, pump efficiency and pump pressure delta, are fixed. The remaining four variables are simulated as if they were produced by real sensors and are continuously published to MQTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a script that subscribes to MQTT and uses the incoming values as inputs to the WaterTap model. Since all six required variables are provided, the degrees of freedom of the model are reduced to zero. As a result, the model operates as a simulation rather than an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the simulation, we extract the WaterTap computed pump work and publish it back to MQTT. This output behaves like a soft sensor, where the value is derived from a physics based model rather than a physical measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of the system architecture:\n",

    "We then modeled this system using a knowledge graph based on the WaTr ontology. The knowledge graph captures the structure of the pump, its associated variables, and the relationships between physical components, sensor streams, and computed quantities. This semantic representation allows us to reason over both the system topology and the available data streams, enabling flexible discovery, querying, and integration of sensor measurements and model derived values.\n",

    "Given a knowledge graph model, Acquirium can connect to MQTT and subscribe to the corresponding data streams. From Acquirium’s perspective, it does not matter whether the values are simulated or produced by real sensors; it simply consumes the data published on MQTT. In addition to MQTT, Acquirium can also connect to other data sources such as files, databases, and external services, providing a unified interface for accessing heterogeneous data streams. \n",
