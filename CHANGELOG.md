The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

change in any release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Default `timeseries_backend` is now `duckdb` when no `acquirium.toml` is
  present, so `pip install acquirium && acquirium server` starts a working
  server with no external services. Set
  `ACQUIRIUM_TIMESERIES_BACKEND=timescale` (or configure it in
  `acquirium.toml`) to opt back into Postgres/TimescaleDB.
- `ipykernel` moved out of the runtime dependency set into a `notebook`
  optional extra; install with `pip install "acquirium[notebook]"`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Initial public release on PyPI.
- `acquirium` CLI entry point.
- Client API (`Acquirium`, `Query`, `DataObject`).
- Apps framework (`App`, `Output`, `AppContext`).
- Driver framework (`Driver`, `IngestDriver`, `EventIngestDriver`, `PollingIngestDriver`).
- Built-in drivers and WaterTAP integration (optional `watertap` extra).
- Text matcher backed by FastEmbed with QUDT and graph indexes.
- Grafana dashboard helpers.
